# Perceptron

### Description:
* This is a manual applicatino of a Perceptron single neuron algorithm. The Perceptron was the first artificial neural network node created. This algorithm serves as a base of every neural network. This project was created by a necessity to understand the math behind the the algorithm. 

### Future updates:

- UI for data testing and result output.
- UI for training dataset input
- Run inside a container for portability purposes.

### What's a Perceptron?

* The perceptron was an algorithm created in 1943, this is the first neural network tecnology used by man.
